# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains all my **lab tasks**, **assignments**, and **quizzes** from the *Data Structures* course, implemented in **C++**.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `Arrays/` â€“ Programs related to 1D and 2D arrays
- `Linked Lists/` â€“ Singly, doubly, and circular linked list implementations
- `Stacks/` â€“ Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists
- `Queues/` â€“ Linear and circular queues, including dequeue
- `Trees/` â€“ Binary trees, BSTs, AVL trees, and traversals
- `Graphs/` â€“ Representations, BFS, DFS
- `Sorting & Searching/` â€“ Bubble sort, merge sort, binary search, etc.
- `Assignments/` â€“ Course assignments based on real-world problems
- `Quizzes/` â€“ Short implementations to test logic and understanding

## ðŸ’¡ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Pointers
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix & List, Traversals)
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Recursion

## ðŸ’» How to Run the Programs

Use any C++ compiler (like `g++` or Code::Blocks) to compile and run the `.cpp` files:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
